# The problem Do.Donate solves

### India, with its population of 1.2 billion people, needs 12 million units of blood annually but collects only 9 million - a 25% deficit. Moreover, Blood donation in India dropped 30% after the court ruling that selling blood and paying donors is illegal in India. Also, the covid 19 periods brought a void in field donation and camp.

## In our blockchain-based web application:-

- We are providing a solution that motivates users to donate Blood.
- Users can visit hospitals where when they donate blood then in return, users will get ethers sanctioned in their name on the manager smart contract.
- But, users can only spend those ethers only for health purposes in only those hospitals which are registered on our website.
- Users will never receive ethers directly in their wallet so they will not be able to spend those ethers elsewhere.
- Only Admin can register new hospital and account details will be sent via email.
- Hospitals can register a user only using their Aadhar details and the credentials of their account will send through SMS.
- Now these registered hospitals can accept donations and have to provide medical facilities in exchange for ethers.
- The Donation Date will be forged on the ethereum contract and the user once donated can only donate after a fixed period of time (3 months for males and 4 months for females) this will help in preventing forced or illegal donation for money.
- There is a chatbot and a help page for the user's convenience.
